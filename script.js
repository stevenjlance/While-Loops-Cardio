// 4. A numlist has been created for you. Use a while loop to add 10 random numbers to this list. HINT - Remember we can add to a list using .push()
var numList = [];
var random;



// 5. Our favorite foods list is back! Print out each of the favorite foods using a while loop. HINT: Think about how you can use the .length property here!
