var counter = 0;
// 1. Edit the program below to print the numbers 0-99. 
while(counter < 10){
  console.log(counter);
  
  // Increase counter by 1 every time through the loop
  counter = counter + 1;
}

// 2. Edit the program to print the word "Hello" 100 times. 
counter = 0;
while(counter < 10){
  console.log("Hello");
  
  // Increase counter by 1 every time through the loop
  counter++;
}

// 3. Write a while loop that tells you how many numbers it has counted up to. E.g. "I have counted to 1", "I have counted to 2", etc. stop when you get to 20.
counter = 0;




// 4. Create a new while loop to give you all the powers of 2 (e.g. 2^0, 2^1, etc.) up to 10.





// 5. A variable called random has been created. Use a while loop to print out 10 random numbers between 0 and 10. 
// NOTE: Math.floor(Math.random()*11) returns a random number between 0 and 10. 
counter = 0;
var random;


// 6. How could we modify what we did above and add all the numbers to an array? Remember .push adds a value to a list!
var randNumbers = [];
counter = 0;



// 7. Finally, we want to count up and tell the user if their number is even or odd. Count to 20 and print out a statement saying 1 is odd, 2 is even, etc. all the way to 20!
counter = 0;




// ============= WHILE LOOPS CARDIO ==================
// 8. Create a while loop that counts to 10. Print out each value.



// 9. Create a while loop that prints out a word (like Hello!) 5 times.



// 10. Count to 22, but this time print out a message that tells the user how many numbers they have counted to (E.g "I have counted to 1", "I have counted to 2", etc.)




// 11. A numlist has been created for you. Use a while loop to add 10 random numbers to this list. HINT - Remember we can add to a list using .push()
var numList = [];
var random;



// 12. Our favorite foods list is back! Print out each of the favorite foods using a while loop. HINT: Think about how you can use the .length property here! 
var favFoods = ["Pizza", "Chicken", "Pasta", "Chocolate"];



// 13. Make a list of your favorite TV shows. Use a while loop to print out a sentence saying each of your favorite shows (e.g. "I like to watch Stranger Things", "I like to watch Game of Thrones", etc.)




// 14. STRETCH: Heads/Tails: Using a while loop and random numbers, make a program that flips a coin 10 times and prints out if you flipped heads or tails. Finally, return a message telling them how many times they filpped heads or tails.
