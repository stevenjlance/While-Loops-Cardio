## GOAL

Today you are going to apply your knowledge of while loops and arrays in order to complete itterative processes. Remember the basic structure of a while loop is that it will continue to run while a given condition remains true. For example:
```javascript
var counter = 0;
while(counter < 10){
  counter++;
  // This will print out numbers 1 to 10. the while loop stops when it gets to a value of 10.
  console.log(counter);
}
```

Once you have increased your proficiency on while loops, we will work to combine these skills with your knowledge of arrays!
